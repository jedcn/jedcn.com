# Overview

Enabling the ability to magnify any part of your screen, at the level
of your window manager (or operating system), is a key piece of
functionality that you should figure out today.

# Background

Zooming into any part of your screen is something you can use every
day:

* When you are working by yourself you can reduce eye fatigue.
* When you are working with one other person, you can make it easier
  for them to "look over your shoulder."
* When you are projecting your computer's display in a small
  conference room with 3 or 4 other people or even a huge conference
  room filled with hundreds of people, someone is going to call out
  (or silently suffering while thinking), "Can you please make this
  larger?"

And when you want to zoom, you'll find yourself saying,

{% blockquote %}
Oh, just one second-- let me try to make this bigger.
{% endblockquote %}

And if you've got this figured out-- it just takes a moment's notice--
less than a second-- and you can make any text huge.

But if you don't have it figured out, you'll start thinking, "How do I
increase the text in <whatever-application-I-am-in>?" It might be easy
or it might not. You might have it fixed in a bit or you might have to
give up and risk people tuning out. Either way-- you'll get off topic.

If you allow "zoom" to be done on an application-by-application basis,
you are guaranteed to have inconsistent results. Your trusty browser
might be just fine, but maybe your editor or a spreadsheet application
will not be.

Perhaps the person you're working with has left her glasses at her
desk. Perhaps you're giving a talk and you see people squinting in the
back row.

Whatever the case,
[Zach Holman is right when he says][speaking-io-tyopgraphy],

{% blockquote Zach Holman http://speaking.io/design/typography %}
I have yet to see a talk that made me think: 'goddamn I canâ€™t read
this because the text is too big'
{% endblockquote %}

# The Solution

In most cases, 15 minutes of research can provide a solution.

I first used this feature on Ubuntu, but now I use MacOS. If you're
using MacOS-- you can easily make it so that pressing CONTROL and then
using a two-finger gesture on the track pad magnifies content in the
neighborhood of the mouse.

Here are the [instructions from bkbeachlabs][bkbeachlabs-screen-zoom] that
I followed.

It takes 5 minutes to implement and you won't look back.
