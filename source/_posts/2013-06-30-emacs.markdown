# Overview

If you work with people that manipulate text for their livelihood
then, sooner or later, you will hear about either
[Emacs][wikipedia-emacs] or [Vim][wikipedia-vim].

Emacs is my editor of choice right now, but I also happen to be
surrounded by people that often ask: "Why do you use Emacs?"

If you're considering Emacs, or wondering why anyone would, this post
details [my emacs configuration][github-jedcn-emacs-setup], a few
resources for further reading, and a some videos about standout
functionality that's present in emacs: [magit][vimeo-magit-screencast]
and [org-mode][youtube-org-carsten-video].

# Background

One great way to see what Emacs is all about is to watch
[this video][youtube-emacs-rocks-web-rebels]. The presenter,
[Magnar Sveen][github-magnars], is both adept at Emacs and
entertaining. It's a 20 minute whirl designed to show off some cool
features.

I self-identify as an emacs beginner, and according to
[this post][vivek-levels-of-emacs], I'm somewhere between a 2 and a 3
(out of a possible 6) in terms of mastery. That said- I've taken care
to document my configuration using Literate Programming as
[described here by Sacha Chua][sacha-chua-emacs-config].

This means that if you look at
[my configuration][github-jedcn-emacs-setup], you'll see the main
features of Emacs that I use. There's nothing special: outside of
plain old editing, I enjoy using magit and org-mode.

Both features merit further discussion.

## Magit

If you use git (or are learning to use git), it's hard to overstate
how sweet magit is. This is especially so for its support of `git add
--interactive`. Here's a link to a screencast that
[provides a good overview][vimeo-magit-screencast] of what's possible.

## Org Mode

Moving onto Org-mode, it describes itself as:

> ..for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects, and
> authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system.

There are a number of [tutorials online][org-tutorials], and back in
2008 I remember being somewhat slack jawed at
[Carsten Dominik's talk about Org at Google][youtube-org-carsten-video].

I use it mainly for tracking tasks, embedding snippets of code or
shell output, and taking notes through the day.

## Emacs Rocks!

While we're talking about videos, the the same crew behind
[this video mentioned above][youtube-emacs-rocks-web-rebels] produce a
series of videos at [emacsrocks.com][emacs-rocks]. I remember watching
these thinking I'd just watch one or two, but
[Magnar's][github-magnars] approach is so light hearted, enthusiastic,
and entertaining that I couldn't help myself.

# Emacs Websites

Aside from videos, there are a number of sites with pretty nice Emacs
content, and the ones that I check out regularly are:

* [http://sachachua.com][sacha-chua]
* [http://whattheemacsd.com][what-the-emacs-d]
* [http://emacsrocks.com/][emacs-rocks]
* [http://emacsredux.com/][emacs-redux]

And I also like
[David Rothlis' How to Learn Emacs][rothlis-emacs-how-to-learn] for
getting started.

# In Closing

I know that Emacs isn't for everyone, and I know that there's a rather
large learning curve, but there's a bunch to enjoy in figuring this
out.

If you read the following excerpt from
[The New Frontiers in Text Editing][haldar-new-frontiers] and find it
intriguing, I think you should give Emacs or Vim a whirl:

> Overall, I think text editing is a solved problem. Text editors are
> like wine. The older the better. You do not want a shiny new text
> editor. You want the text editor that has been around long enough
> and used by enough geeks that every conceivable pattern of
> manipulating symbols on the screen has been thought of, and
> crystallized into a re-usable pack.

If you do go down that path and you'd like to chat about Emacs
[configuration stuff][github-jedcn-emacs-setup], shoot me an email.
