# Overview

If you work with people that manipulate text for their livelihood
then, sooner or later, you will hear about either
[Emacs][wikipedia-emacs] or [Vim][wikipedia-vim].

Emacs is my editor of choice right now, but I also happen to be
surrounded by people that wonder, "Why Emacs?"

I'm not sure that anyone should get involved with either editor, but,
if you're considering emacs, this post details my history with the
two, highlights two features exclusive to emacs: `magit` and
`org-mode`, and contains a link to my
[emacs configuration][jedcn-emacs-setup].

# Background

I first became aware of emacs 15 years ago. At the time, as a Unix
administrator, I picked vim because of its ubiquity.

A few years later, in a different setting, I found myself needing to
author a larger document in order to graduate. Most of my peers were
using Microsoft Word. I considered it, but heard that unfortunate
things were happening to their documents as they grew and entered the
realm of dozens and dozens of graphs, figures, tables, and footnotes.

Another alternative at my school was to use emacs and
[LaTeX][wikipedia-latex] instead of Word. This held real appeal: LaTeX
documents are beautiful, and the idea of being able to break this
large paper into plain text files that could be tracked in version
control held real appeal.

I finished [my paper][jedcn-mit-thesis], graduated, and then moved
away from emacs while authoring Java in IDEs. So, between 2004 and
2011, I only used emacs in a limited fashion. Then, starting in 2011,
I shifted to Ruby (sans IDE) and have picked up my emacs usage since.

This is not say that I won't go to vim someday, but there's still a
bunch to learn in the emacs camp before I do.

# Why Emacs?

With what little I know about vim, I think that magit and org-mode are
two areas where Emacs offers an experience that's both different from
vim but also quite useful and fun.

Magit and Org mode are easy to get started with, and yet both have a
depth fo features that takes some time to explore.

There are a series of easily accessible, spirited videos about emacs
from "Emacs Rocks!" and I'd guess that if these don't show you why
emacs is worthwhile then nothing will.

## Magit

[Git][wikipedia-git] came about back in 2005, and somewhere after
[magit][github-magit] followed. It's hard to overstate how sweet magit
is. Here's a link to a screencast that
[provides a good overview][magit-screencast] of what's possible.

## Org Mode

Org Mode is also out of this world, and is exclusive to emacs. It
describes itself as:

> Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning
> projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective
> plain-text system.

There are a number of [tutorials online][org-tutorials], and back in
2008 I remember being somewhat slack jawed at
[Carsten Dominik's talk about Org at Google][org-carsten-video].

## Emacs in a Bar

The Magit and Org videos referenced above are well done, but there's
something about the enthusiasm and style about
[this video][emacs-rocks-web-rebels] done by the Emacs Rocks crew
(Magnar Sveen) that is really spectacular.

## Emacs Rocks!

The same crew behind the "Emacs in a Bar" above maintain a site and
produce a series of videos at [emacsrocks.com][emacs-rocks].

# In Closing

I suspect that most people have a strong reaction to the following
quote from [Vivek Haldar][haldar-new-frontiers]:

> Overall, I think text editing is a solved problem. Text editors are
> like wine. The older the better. You do not want a shiny new text
> editor. You want the text editor that has been around long enough
> and used by enough geeks that every conceivable pattern of
> manipulating symbols on the screen has been thought of, and
> crystallized into a re-usable pack.

If you agree with it, consider giving either vim or Emacs a try.

Here's the setup I use:
[github.com/jedcn/emacs-setup][jedcn-emacs-setup]. It's
relatively nascent-- but if you want to talk specifics,
