# Overview

Consider swapping out the standard "less" pager for one that has
syntax highlighting.

Here's one way to achieve this:


[cless][cless], which builds on [c][c].

Back in 2012, Paul Irish [tweeted a neat way][cat-tweet] to make "cat"
colorized.

If you do this, and you like this, you can get a colorized less with
no more work than a two line shell function.

If you're looking for another way to get syntax highlighting with
less, there's something called lesspipe, but I haven't looked into it
yet.

So far I'm happy with cless.
