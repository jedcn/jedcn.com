I have mostly been in engineering leadership positions for the past few years.

Prior to that, I was a software engineer that mainly did [front-end
work][resume].

If you would like to get in touch, [email][hi-jedcn-com] is probably
best.

The most important thing to know about me is which [t-shirts I
wear][wears-t-shirts].
