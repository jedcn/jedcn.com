## About

I make my living as a Software Engineer, and this site contains a
version of my [resume].

[resume]: /resume/

However, resumes are not always the best way to describe what you do
for work. This site also contains an informal
[summary of my career][career].

[career]: /career/

I have a number of side projects. These are documented at
[https://jedcn.github.io/].

[https://jedcn.github.io/]: https://jedcn.github.io/

If you would like to get in touch, [email][hi-jedcn-com] is probably
best.
