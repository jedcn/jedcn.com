# Life is too short.

It's too short for anger.

It's too short for fear.

It's *just* too short.

# People carry around more than you know.

They have bad days.

They can be hurt.

They love people who can be hurt.

They lose people that they love.

# We're all in this together.

We're not perfect.

But we can help each other.

We're not perfect.

But we can make a choice to help if given the chance.

We can make a choice not to hurt.
