# Life is too short.

It's too short for anger.

It's too short for fear.

It's *just* too short.

# People carry around more than you know.

They have bad days.

They can be hurt.

They love people who can be hurt.

They lose people that they love.

# We're all in this together.

We're not perfect, but.

We can, and should, focus on helping rather than hurting.
